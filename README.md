Task 4 
TASK 1: We have a function called processArray that changes numbers in a list:

Even numbers get multiplied by themselves.
Odd numbers get multiplied by 3.
So, if we start with [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], we end up with[15, 36, 21, 64, 27].

TASK 2: Another function, formatArrayStrings, changes words in a list based on numbers:

If the number is even, the word is shouted (all uppercase).
If the number is odd, the word is whispered (all lowercase).
With the words ['God  ', 'bless ', 'you'] and numbers [6, 3, 9], we get[ 'GOD  ', 'bless ', 'you' ]

TASK 3: The last function, createUserProfiles, makes a list of user info:

It takes two lists of names and pairs them up.
It also gives each pair a number.
